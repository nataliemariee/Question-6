## Why this question?
Just a couple weeks ago, I actually really had to use the restroom on a flight from NYC to LA. I was really nervous to ask the people next to me to move out of the way so that I could use the restroom because I was sitting in the window seat. ðŸ˜Ž

To my surprise, this data shows that most people think it's okay to get up even three times during this flight (according to those sampled in this survey). Now I know that most people won't mind if I need to get up once or twice to use the restroom on a flight from NYC to LA.
